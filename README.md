# HelioX — Tokenized Mobility Infrastructure on NEAR

HelioX transforms real-world vehicles into programmable digital assets on NEAR Protocol, connecting physical mobility with on-chain economic logic.

Built for NEARCON Innovation Sandbox, HelioX demonstrates how Real World Assets (RWA) can integrate with smart contracts, oracles, and fractional ownership to create decentralized and scalable mobility infrastructure.

## The Problem

Today vehicles remain:

- Illiquid physical assets
- Expensive and difficult to access
- Controlled by centralized intermediaries
- Disconnected from programmable economic systems

Current mobility infrastructure limits economic participation and intelligent automation.

## The Solution — What HelioX Delivers

HelioX converts physical vehicles into on-chain economic infrastructure through:

1. NFT Tokenization (NEP-171)  
   Each vehicle is represented as a unique NFT with dynamic metadata.

2. Fractional Ownership (NEP-141)  
   The vehicle’s value is divided into fungible tokens, enabling accessible participation.

3. Smart Contracts on NEAR  
   Execute programmable economic logic and manage transfers, rules, and events.

4. Oracle Integration  
   Physical vehicle data (simulated in the MVP) connects to on-chain decisions.

5. Decentralized Marketplace  
   Enables secure and transparent trading of fractional participation.

## Mobility as a Service (MaaS)

HelioX lays the foundation for a decentralized Mobility as a Service (MaaS) model:

- Enables economic access without purchasing a full vehicle
- Facilitates collective participation in physical infrastructure
- Automates economic decisions through on-chain rules
- Reduces dependence on centralized intermediaries

HelioX is not traditional renting — it is programmable infrastructure for decentralized mobility.

---

## Real World Assets (RWA)

Each vehicle in HelioX is treated as a Real World Asset (RWA):

- Verifiable digital identity
- Programmable fractional ownership
- Connection between physical data and blockchain decisions
- Full transparency in economic management

This turns physical assets into interoperable components of the Web3 ecosystem.

## Scalability — Designed for Growth

HelioX is designed to scale in three dimensions:

### Transactional Scalability

NEAR uses Nightshade (sharding), enabling:

- Parallel transaction processing
- Support for thousands of vehicles
- Handling millions of microtransactions
- Low and predictable costs

### Economic Scalability

Fractional ownership enables:

- Participation from low capital amounts
- Programmable revenue distribution
- Expanded access to physical assets

### Data Scalability

Each vehicle acts as a data node:

- Future integration with real IoT devices
- Distributed operational dataset
- Foundation for intelligent automation and predictive maintenance

## What Is Already Implemented

- Dynamic NFTs (NEP-171)  
- Fractional fungible tokens (NEP-141)  
- Smart contracts deployed on testnet  
- Functional marketplace  
- Oracle integration (simulated)  
- Wallet-connected dApp  

HelioX is already operating on NEAR testnet executing real economic logic.

## Roadmap

Phase 1 — Tokenization and fractionalization (Current MVP)  
Phase 2 — Rule-based on-chain automation  
Phase 3 — Autonomous agent integration  
Phase 4 — NEAR Intents integration  
Phase 5 — Advanced intelligent mobility infrastructure  

---

## Future Evolution — Autonomous Agents

The current architecture allows evolution toward:

- Autonomous agents executing economic decisions
- Event-triggered execution from real physical data
- Simplified user experience through NEAR Intents
- Semi-autonomous fleet management systems

HelioX builds the foundation for physical infrastructure that can operate as programmable economic entities.

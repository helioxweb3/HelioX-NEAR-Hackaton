# HelioX — Tokenized Mobility Infrastructure on NEAR

HelioX transforms real-world vehicles into **programmable digital assets** on NEAR Protocol, connecting physical mobility with on-chain economic logic.

Built for **NEARCON Innovation Sandbox**, HelioX demonstrates how Real World Assets (RWA) can integrate with smart contracts, oracles, and fractional ownership to create decentralized and scalable mobility infrastructure.

## 🌍 The Problem

Today vehicles remain:

- Illiquid physical assets
- Expensive and difficult to access
- Controlled by centralized intermediaries
- Disconnected from programmable economic systems

Current mobility infrastructure limits economic participation and intelligent automation.

## 🚀 The Solution — What HelioX Delivers

HelioX converts physical vehicles into on-chain economic infrastructure through:

1. **NFT Tokenization (NEP-171)**  
   Each vehicle is represented as a unique NFT with dynamic metadata.

2. **Fractional Ownership (NEP-141)**  
   The vehicle’s value is divided into fungible tok

2. **Fractional Ownership (NEP-141)**  
   The vehicle’s value is divided into fungible tokens, enabling accessible participation.

3. **Smart Contracts on NEAR**  
   Execute programmable economic logic and manage transfers, rules, and events.

4. **Oracle Integration**  
   Physical vehicle data (simulated in the MVP) connects to on-chain decisions.

5. **Decentralized Marketplace**  
   Enables secure and transparent trading of fractional participation.
